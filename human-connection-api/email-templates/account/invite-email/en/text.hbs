DEAR SUPPORTER,
WE ARE ONLINE!

Today we’re inviting you to the alpha version of Human Connection. And we couldn’t be more excited to give you first access as one of our initial supporters. YAY!

Here is your Invite-Code: {{ code }}

Just click on the following link to create your Alpha Account:

{{ frontURL }}/auth/register?email={{ email }}&code={{ code }}&lang={{ language }} [{{ frontURL }}/auth/register?email={{ email }}&code={{ code }}&lang={{ language }}]

Please know that we are inviting our donors in groups of a thousand successively - that means not every supporter will be active in the alpha version immediately.


Here are a few important things you should know:

 * Because this is an alpha version we can’t guarantee that all data you enter during this phase will remain available. In order for your contributions to not get lost, we recommend that you save valuable content you contributed on the network on your local  computer as well. Please don’t save any important information on the network only as you might not find it again due to the alpha test phase.

 * Should you notice errors on the network (and we’re pretty sure that it will happen), please inform us about these since it will help us improve the platform and your user experience.

   Therefore we provide following email: bugfix@human-connection.org [bugfix@human-connection.org]
   You can send us any errors or glitches via email as follows:- what? (describe the error or better yet, include a screenshot)
   - when? (date and time of occurrence)
   - where? (which view/location)
   - how? (click path)
   - browser, operating system and version are helpful


If you’d like to know what functionalities you can expect in the alpha version of Human Connection, you can get an overview over our roadmap here: https://human-connection.org/en/roadmap/ [https://human-connection.org/en/roadmap/]
